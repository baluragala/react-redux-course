The objective of these solutions is to make asynchronous programming resemble close to our mental model. With programming languages like Java, C#, python, code always executes in synchronously and can be blocking the control – with a valid reason – those languages have multithreading capabilities and can do multiple things at same time by spawning multiple threads but Javascript being single threaded there is no space to block the code execution hence there is a need to work with single thread efficiently without blocking",
